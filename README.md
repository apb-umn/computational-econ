<h1 style="text-align: center; font-size: 60 ;"> Computational Macro: Topics</h1>



# Aiyagari Model

* Review steady state computations in the standard model

    + Endogenous grid method

    + Histogram method

* Transitions between steady states in the standard model

    + global methods

    + perturbational methods

* Extend the standard model 
    
    + Entrepreneurship (discrete choice)

    + Multiple assets (sweat capital or illiquid capital)
    
* Welfare Analysis
    
    + Stabilization policies



# Additional Topics

* Review continuous time methods

    + control problems using HJB equations

    + distributional dynamics using Kolmogrov Forward equations


* Applications
  

  + Lucas-Hopenhayan Firm Dynamics 

  + update to add capital that is indivisible, nonrentable and bilaterally traded



# Structure of the Class

* Will work through the main ideas  using a simple case

    + Pseudo code on the board

    + Actual steps using some sample Julia code

* Assignment: Apply the ideas to a slightly more advanced example

* For example: 

    + In the Aiyagari part, I will do the class using a model with inelastic labor supply

    + Assignments will have elastic labor supply
